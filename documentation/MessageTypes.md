# WVU Swarm Standard Messages
This file documents the ROS message types declared in our ``wvu_swarm_std_msgs`` package, located at ``swarm_ws/src/wvu_swarm_std_msgs``. These messages are designed to allow our ROS packages to communicate with each other in as standardized a way as possible.

## Maintenance
To add a message, follow the standard process of adding a ROS message. Simply add a file into ``wvu_swarm_std_msgs/msgs`` with the extension ``.msg`` with the variable types to be contained in that message. Then, be sure to add the name of your file to ``wvu_swarm_std_msgs/CMakeLists.txt``.
